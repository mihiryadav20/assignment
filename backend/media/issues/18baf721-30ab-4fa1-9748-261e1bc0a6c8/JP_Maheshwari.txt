Thank you for your proposal to partner and build ideas together. After consulting with fellow founders and venture capital contacts, I’m excited about the potential to collaborate with Ebaco, given your expertise in sports infrastructure. I’d like to propose two counter offers that align our strengths and maximize value for both sides.


1. Strategic Partnership with Equity for Expertise


The global sports infrastructure market exceeds $100 Billion, with tech solutions (CRMs, project management tools) capturing a growing share. Even a 1% tech spend positions our software as a unicorn contender. While I’m confident in building industry-leading software, scaling in this niche requires deep domain expertise, this is where Ebaco excels.

I propose a strategic partnership where Ebaco provides industry insights, client introductions, or seed funding in exchange for a minority equity stake and an advisory role. We’d jointly target early adopters, offering them the chance to become strategic investors, a model VCs view as a strong signal of product-market fit. This structure leverages your network and our technical prowess to dominate the sports tech space.


2. Project-Based Collaboration to Test Compatibility


If you’re exploring ideas beyond SaaS for sports infrastructure, I propose a short-term project-based collaboration. I’d develop a specific solution, such as a prototype or feature, on a contractual basis with clear deliverables and a consulting fee. This lets us test our working styles and shared vision without long-term commitments. My technical expertise ensures we deliver industry-standard solutions, complementing your domain knowledge. At the end, we can evaluate a deeper partnership.


I admire Ebaco’s commitment to leveraging technology in sports infrastructure, a sector ripe for innovation in India and globally. Countries like the USA and China have shown how tech drives efficiency in their industrial spaces, and I believe we can achieve a similar impact here.


I’d love to discuss these options in detail. Please let me know your availability.
